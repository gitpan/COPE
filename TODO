TODO file for COPE, in strictly random order.

Implement the POA

Environment variable for the UDP broadcaster port

there are object leaks in the BOA; when an object is removed from the BOA, we
don't take it out of the implementation/skeleton hash table.  That means the
memory is never freed (and the object destructors aren't called).

Write still more tests

Write lots of documentation

Add all cases to the marshalling routines instead of the current "on demand"
approach.

Finish the NamingService

Write our own IR (and all of COSS, of course)

Review the name and module hierarchy

Add a proper Any type

Figure out the proper interface for the Dynamic Skeleton Interface (probably
not much work)

Review design

Implement Unions

Do a dependency analysis for the generated types
